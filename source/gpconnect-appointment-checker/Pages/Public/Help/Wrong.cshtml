<h2>I can’t see any appointments, what’s wrong?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why the search has brought back zero results:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Provider system is not set up as a GP Connect enabled practice or hub.</li>
    <li>The Provider system is not enabled for GP Connect Appointments.</li>
    <li>The slots for the date range you have selected are all before the current date and time (for example, if you are checking for the current week at 16:00 on Friday). Try checking for a later week (date range).</li>
    <li>The GP Connect-bookable slots have all been booked (none are free)</li>
    <li>The Practitioner who is associated with the GP Connect slots has not been assigned a GP Connect Role.</li>
    <li>The practice has restricted the slots so they are visible only to certain Consumers, not including the one you have used for the search. Try checking with another Consumer.</li>
    <li>The practice has made slots available to GP Connect but they are under embargo.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no slots are being returned, please contact your GP Connect Implementation & Business Change Lead for further assistance.</p>
