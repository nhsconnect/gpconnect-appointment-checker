<h2>What does the Appointment Checker do?</h2>
<p>The Appointment Checker shows you appointments which have been set up in a specified healthcare setting (Provider) and are available to be booked by another service (Consumer) using GP Connect. Once a search has been made, it will display any slots which have been set up correctly. Those that have been set up incorrectly will not be displayed and further investigation will be required to understand why they are configured incorrectly.</p>
<p>The 'Provider' organisation can be a GP Practice or any other organisation which has a GP Foundation system installed and is enabled for GP Connect.</p>
<p>The 'Consumer' organisation can be any organisation with an ODS code. As appointment slots may be made available by the provider to all organisations of a particular type, it is also possible to search by organisation type, if you have been granted permission to do so by the System Administrator. In this case the option to 'Select a consumer organisation type' will be shown on the search screen.</p>
