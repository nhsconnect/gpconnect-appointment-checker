# GP Connect Appointment Configuration Checker

The GP Connect Appointment Configuration Checker is a web application that allows users to view free appointment slots in a GP practice's appointment book, exposed via the GP Connect API, in the same way that a GP Connect Appointments Consumer System would.

This is to allow practice staff to validate their GP Connect appointment book configuration, and to allow operational staff to assist them in doing so.
